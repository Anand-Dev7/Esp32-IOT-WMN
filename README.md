## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Required Libraries**:

   - Use the Arduino Library Manager to install the libraries listed above.

2. **Configure OpenWeatherMap API**:

   - Replace the `apiKey` and `city` variables in the code with your OpenWeatherMap API key and city name:
     ```cpp
     const String apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY";
     const String city = "YOUR_CITY_NAME";
     ```

3. **Upload the Code**:

   - Connect your ESP32 to your computer and upload the code using the Arduino IDE.

4. **Connect to WiFi**:

   - On first boot, the ESP32 will create a WiFi access point named `ESP32-IOT`. Connect to it and configure your WiFi credentials.

5. **Power the Device**:
   - Connect the battery and ensure all components are properly powered.

## Usage

- **Screen Navigation**:
  - Use the `BUTTON_LEFT` and `BUTTON_RIGHT` to navigate between screens (Time/Weather, Audio Player, Notes).
- **Audio Player**:
  - Use `BUTTON_SELECT` to play/pause audio.
  - Use `BUTTON_LEFT` and `BUTTON_RIGHT` to switch tracks.
  - Use `BUTTON_BACK` to stop playback.
- **Notes**:
  - Use `BUTTON_SELECT` to add characters to notes.
  - Use `BUTTON_LEFT` and `BUTTON_RIGHT` to select characters.
  - Use `BUTTON_BACK` to exit character selection.
  - Hold `BUTTON_CLEAR` for 5 seconds to clear all notes.
- **Battery Monitoring**:
  - The battery percentage is displayed on the top-right corner of the screen.

## Screens

1. **Time and Weather**:
   - Displays the current time, weather, and WiFi status.
2. **Audio Player**:
   - Controls for playing, pausing, and switching tracks.
3. **Notes**:
   - Allows users to create and manage notes.

## Troubleshooting

- **OLED Not Displaying**:
  - Check the I2C connections and ensure the address is set to `0x3C`.
- **WiFi Not Connecting**:
  - Ensure the WiFi credentials are correct and the ESP32 is within range of the router.
- **DFPlayer Not Working**:
  - Ensure the DFPlayer is properly connected and the SD card contains valid audio files.
